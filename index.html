                <p>A story by Maria Volkova</p>

                   The onset of the pandemic caused restaurants to shutter, stores to close and pushed much of the nations workforce to sit at home.
                   
                     After long bouts of isolation, many turned to adopting furry friends as a way to retain sanity. This data, gathered from a shelter in Austin, looks at adoption rates and trends during the pandemic.

<p class="subtitle">The graph only accounts for dogs and cats that were adopted from the shelter</p>
                
                <p>
                    According to data from the Austin Animal Center, a municipal shelter for the city of Austin, animal adoption significantly increased at the end of 2020.
                    The rate of cat and dog adoptions in December 2020 spiked by more than 50% compared to January 2020. The most prominent spikes, however, happened in mid-2021. 
                    Most notably, July 2021 saw the adoption rate almost quadruple year-over-year, with 757 animals adopted from the shelter compared to 259 adoptions in June 2020.
                    
                    
                    Adoption rates are starting to mellow out in 2022, though numbers are still notably above pre-pandemic rates.

                        </script>
                    </p>
                   
                    
                
                
                <p> Cat adoptions dominated from June 2021 through December 2021. There are also notable spikes in cat adoptions in May and June of this year. 
                    As a good chunk of offices have started to open their doors again and most people are venturing back out into society, it is possible that people may still want a furry companion, but one that may be more low- maintenance.

                     From looking at adoption trends in the nation through the microcosm of Austin, we can see that throughout the pandemic, adoptions of animals
                    significantly spiked. An interesting observation is that despite an expectation that adoptions would drop off as a result of 
                    life semi resuming to normal, rates still remain elevated, with people choosing cat adoptions over dog adoptions.
