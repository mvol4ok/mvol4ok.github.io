                <p>A story by Maria Volkova</p>
                <p>
                   Due to the onset of the pandemic, restaurants shuttered, stores closed and much of the nations workforce was pushed
                   to sit at home for months at a time. After long bouts of isolation, many turned to adopting furry friends as a way 
                   retain sanity. This data, gathered from a shelter in Austin, looks at adoption rates and trends during the pandemic.

                    According to data from the Austin Animal Center, a municipal shelter for the city of Austin, animal adoption significantly increased at the end of 2020.
                    Adoptions from December 2020 spiked by more than 50% compared to January 2020. 
                    The rate of adoptions saw the most prominent spike from June to November in 2021.
                    Most notably, July 2021 saw the adoption rate skyrocket, with 757 animals (either cat or dog) given a home compared to 259 adoptions in June 2020.
                    
                    
                    Adoption rates are starting to mellow out in 2022. However, numbers are still notably above pre-pandemic rates.

                <p> Cat adoptions dominated from June 2021 through December 2021. There are also notable spikes in cat adoptions in May 2022 and June 2022. These spikes may be correlated with life
                    returning to a semi-normal rhythm of work and hobbies and people may still want a furry companion, but one that may be more 
                    low-maintenance.

                <p>
                    From looking at adoption trends in the nation through the microcosm of Austin, we can see that throughout the pandemic, adoptions of animals
                    significantly spiked. An interesting observation is that despite an expectation that adoptions would drop off as a result of 
                    life semi resuming to normal, rates still remain elevated, with people choosing cat adoptions over dog adoptions.
